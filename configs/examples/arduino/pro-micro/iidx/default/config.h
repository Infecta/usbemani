// The Arduino Pro Micro is a general development board.
// The following provides a sample user configuration for the Pro Micro dev board in a IIDX controller.

// Our example controller requires no additional configuration, so our "default" config will be fairly empty.
// However, other controller configs are available to e.g. enable PS2 support or use a different encoder PPR.

/*** Additional Includes ***/
// We'll include some friendly USB labels in a separate file.
